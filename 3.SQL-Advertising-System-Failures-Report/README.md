## Description

As part of HackerAd's advertising system analytics, a team needs a list of customers who have a maximum number of failure events (status = "failure") in their campaigns. For all customers with more than 3 events with status = 'failure', report the customer name and their number of failures. The result should be in the following format: customer, failures.

- customer is a candidate's full name, the first_name and last_name separated by a single space.
- The order of the output is not important.
